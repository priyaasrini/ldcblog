# From linear logic to quantum mechanics

Traditionally, Hilbert spaces are used as the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics. While this framework support detailed computation, they 
do not support an intuition for the problem: this leads to an approach described as "shut up and calculate". 
The programme of **categorical quantum mechanics**   emerged out of the desire to develop an intuitive framework that aids human thinking to represent and reason about quantum processes. What is more intuitive than pictures! Categorical quantum mechanics indeed gave a pictorial way to represent quantum process, yet these pictures have precise meaning to them. 

Linear logic captures the essence of quantum mechanics owing to its 
resource-sensitive character. We saw that in linear logic one cannot duplicate an arbitrary resource: in quantum mechanics, this is 
referred to as the *no-cloning theorem* which states that it is impossible to duplicate an arbitrary quantum state. 
Motivated by this connection, the field of categorical quantum mechanics uses the compact multiplicative linear logic as the base framework for its purpose, 
and added the notion of dagger to this fragment, thus giving rise to compact dagger-linear logic.  The 'dagger' abstracts the notion of 'adjoint' 
which is crucial to quantum mechanics: the measurable properties of a quantum system are 
given by self-adjoint operators on a separable Hilbert space, that is, a Hilbert space with 
countable orthonormal basis. 

While monoidal categories provide the semantics for compact MLL, dagger-monoidal categories provide the categorical semantics for 
compact dagger-linear logic.  CQM uses dagger-monoidal categories,  specifically, dagger-compact closed 
categories to develop a high-level, intuitive, formal language for quantum mechanics 
by abstracting the standard, traditionally-used, analytical framework of Hilbert spaces, as illustrated below:
